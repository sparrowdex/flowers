# Changelog

All notable changes to the "Flowers for the Beloved" project will be documented in this file.

## [2024-05-22]

### Changed
- **Lotus Scene**: Renamed `jaisu.jsx` to `jaiswal.jsx` and updated all internal references.
- **Lotus Interaction**: Replaced the "Open/Close" button with direct click interaction. Each flower now animates independently and smoothly.
- **Blue Orchid Scene (kaashvi.jsx)**: Updated the Dark Mode background to a radial blue gradient for better depth.
- **Blue Orchid Lighting**: Reverted post-processing Bloom effects and adjusted petal materials to restore natural shading and prevent a "flat" look.
- **Plant Data**: Updated `plantData.jsx` to sync with the new `jaiswal` key and `LotusScene` component.
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` to reflect the name change from `jaisu` to `jaiswal`.
